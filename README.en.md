This is a web app for ordering food delivery. Two pages have been created: the
store and the order basket. The store's food database is connected using the
mockapi.io service. After selecting dishes from the menu in the store, they are
then displayed in the order basket. Where you can keep your personal data and
adjust the number of portions of dishes.
